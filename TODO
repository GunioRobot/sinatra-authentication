TODO:
  - write rake task which creates first admin user
    after writing this, change the User.permission_level default value to 0

    implement some way to allow for the creation of users with different
    permission levels in an untamperable manner. Perhaps with some secret key
    that must be sent in the form
  - look at other permissions systems for some feature ideas
  - ?implement a session store which isn't cookie based
  - turn on sessions unless they're already on
    - randomize the session key on every installation
